# Scriptable iOS widgets
This is a small collection of my JavaScript scripts which can be used to create both beautiful and useful widgets.
All of those widgets/scripts were created with the app <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> and they will not work without this app.

### List of all available widgets:
- <a href="https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/scriptable-widgets/tree/main/nasa-pictures">Daily NASA pictures</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/telekom-data-usage-widget">Telekom data usage</a> (only for german telekom customers)
- <a href="https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/scriptable-widgets/tree/main/germany-rain-radar">Germany Rain Radar</a>

### Coming soon:
- Better calendar and reminder widget
- Boca Chica Highway Road Closures
- Information widget (weather, device information, sunrise/set, reminders, calendar, quote of the day, greeting, date)

### General setup to use scripts for Scriptable widgets:
1. Download the app <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a>.
2. Copy the script you want to use.
3. Open the Scriptable app, create a new script (give it a name) and paste the script you just copied.
4. Go to your homescreen, long press and add a Scriptable widget with your preferred size (small, medium, large).
5. Tap on the newly created widget and select the script that you created earlier.
6. Go back to your homescreen and enjoy your widget!

(5.1) If necessary, you can specify any parameters by entering them in the "parameters" box.
