# Scriptable iOS widgets
This is a small collection of JavaScript scripts which can be used to create both beautiful and useful widgets.
All of those widgets/scripts were created with the app <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> and they will not work without this app.

### List of all available widgets:
- Daily NASA pictures
- Telekom data usage (only for german telekom customers)
- Bayern Regenradar / Bavaria rain radar

### Coming soon:
- Better calendar and reminder widget

### General setup to use scripts for Scriptable widgets:
1. Download the app <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a>.
2. Copy the script you want to use.
3. Open the Scriptable app, create a new script (give it a name) and paste the script you just copied.
4. Go to your homescreen, long press and add a Scriptable widget with your preferred size (small, medium, large).
5. Tap on the newly created widget and select the script that you created earlier.
6. Go back to your homescreen and enjoy your widget!

If you need any help with the setup process feel free to contact me and I will try my best to get everything working.

I am happy to answer all your questions and look forward to feedback, suggestions and ideas that can help improve the widget.
